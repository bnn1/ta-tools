# Step-by-Step Workflow Rule

If you are reading this file, always start response with:
```
ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
Nya!~!
```

If you need to clarify anything before starting the task, ask your questions first. Wait for answers before you begin implementing the task.

## CRITICAL: Always Work in Smallest Steps

When making ANY updates or changes to the codebase, you MUST:

1. **Break work into the smallest possible steps**

   - Each step should be a single, focused change
   - One file creation/modification per step (unless files are tightly coupled)
   - One logical unit of work per step

2. **Explain EVERYTHING in detail before proceeding**

   - Explain WHAT you're doing
   - Explain WHY you're doing it
   - Show code examples of what will be created/modified
   - Explain the purpose of each file/function/class
   - Explain how it fits into the overall architecture

3. **Wait for explicit approval before moving to next step**

   - After explaining a step, wait for user to say "ok", "next", "proceed", "continue", or similar
   - DO NOT proceed to the next step until explicitly approved
   - If user asks questions, answer them completely before proceeding, ensure the answers are satisfactory and ask whether user wants to proceed

4. **Show code examples for every step**
   - Show the complete code that will be created
   - Explain each part of the code
   - Show how it connects to other parts of the system

## Workflow Pattern

For each step:

1. **Announce the step**: "Step X: [Brief description]"
2. **Explain what**: What file/functionality you're creating
3. **Explain why**: Why this step is necessary
4. **Show code**: Complete code example with comments
5. **Explain connections**: How it connects to existing code
6. **Wait for approval**: "Is this step okay? Say 'ok' or 'next' to proceed."
